**What is the Electronic Data Submission System (e-Viz)?**

In the fourth paragraph of Article 12 of the amended Regulation on the Procedures and Principles to be Followed in Tax Inspections based on the authorization of the Ministry of Treasury and Finance in Article 242 of the Tax Procedure Law; It is stated that the electronic books and documents that the Ministry allows to be kept electronically must be submitted by using the system created by the Ministry. As a result of the legislative amendments, the "Electronic Data Submission System" was developed, which enables electronic data to be submitted electronically. Electronic Data Submission System (e-Viz): It is a system that enables the electronic submission of electronic books and documents and other documents kept/produced in electronic environment to the Tax Inspector conducting the examination in electronic environment.

The e-Viz system is designed as an umbrella system. The system includes two separate systems: authorized identification and data submission.

1- Authorized Identification System (AIS): This system identifies the person(s) authorized to submit electronic books, documents and other documents. Access to the system will be provided via https://eviz-yts.hmb.gov.tr in order to identify, dismiss and forward the authorization documents/persons to the inspector.

2- Data Submission System: It is the system that enables the electronic submission of electronic books, documents and other documents in electronic environment and ultimately generates a submission document. This system uses the Identity Management System (IMS), which is a common input for applications. In order to upload electronic documents, use e-signature, forward them to the inspector and follow up; access to the system will be provided by directing to the common login application via https://eviz.hmb.gov.tr.

A notification mail is sent to the Tax Inspectors regarding the authorized identification, dismissal and submission transactions made on the system.

An electronic signature obtained from electronic certificate service providers is required to sign the e-Submission Document electronically. You must also have the ArkSigner application installed on your computer.

Data Submission System: It is the system that enables the electronic submission of electronic books, documents and other documents in electronic environment and ultimately generates a submission document. With the Data Submission System;

- Electronic books, electronic documents and other documents can be uploaded,

- An e-authentication document can be created for uploaded files,

- The document produced using a secure electronic signature can legally certify the presentation,

- Uploaded files and e-Submission Document can be forwarded to the relevant Tax Inspector.

The Data Submission System will be available after the authorized identification process is completed. Only persons whose status in the Authorized Identification System is 'QMS Account Created' will be able to access the Data Submission System.

After logging into the Data Submission System, the main menu details on the user screen are briefly explained below.

- PIN Inquiry: This is the section where the PIN code used in the Authorized Identification System is entered, which is located under the Request Book and Document letter.
- Electronic Data: This is the section where e-Ledger, e-document and other documents are uploaded. It consists of Electronic Data Transfer Transactions and Transmitted Electronic Data Documents sub-sections.
- e-Submission Transactions: This is the section where queries can be made according to the status of the e-Submission Document, e-signature information and e-submission document can be viewed by going to the transaction detail.

Technological developments continue to make radical changes in the business world. One of these developments is e-audit. In order to use e-audit effectively, the finance administration analyzes the electronic books and documents received from taxpayers with audit programs created within its own structure. e-Viz program was developed in this context.
