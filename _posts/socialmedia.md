## Taxation of Broadcasters Broadcasting Live on Social Media Platforms

**INTRODUCTION**

‎  ‎  ‎  ‎ While technology advances rapidly, it doesn't change people's traditional ways of life as quickly. However, with the pandemic, people's interest in technology has rapidly increased. Many individuals have become acquainted with live streaming platforms that were previously unknown to them. The most popular live streaming platforms are Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook. The content of the broadcasts is determined by the streamer, and they engage viewers by playing entertaining games, having conversations, or sharing short entertaining videos. Unlike traditional TV, these platforms allow for real-time interaction between streamers and viewers. Streamers generate income through subscriptions, advertisements, and donations.

This article examines how broadcasting is done on social media platforms, how income is generated, and the nature of the income earned in terms of the income categories.
