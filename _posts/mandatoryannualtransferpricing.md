## Mandatory Annual Transfer Pricing Report and Sanctions for Non-Compliance

## Summary

Article 13 of the Corporate Tax Law No. 5520 regulates the issue of hidden profit distribution through transfer pricing. The last paragraph of the said article stipulates that the procedures related to transfer pricing will be determined by the President. In accordance with this provision, the Council of Ministers Decision No. 2007/12888 was issued, in which the procedures related to transfer pricing were determined, and changes were made to this decision with Presidential Decision No. 2151. With the Council of Ministers Decision, the obligation to document transactions with related parties through an "Annual Transfer Pricing Report" was introduced for some taxpayers. Furthermore, in the circulars issued to explain Article 13 of the Corporate Tax Law, parallel to the Council of Ministers Decision, the obligation to prepare an "Annual Transfer Pricing Report" was also stated. Although the obligation to prepare a report has been introduced, there are no sanctions foreseen in the legal regulations for taxpayers who do not comply with this obligation. In practice, it is observed that some taxpayers are not aware of the obligation to prepare an "Annual Transfer Pricing Report" and do not prepare it.
